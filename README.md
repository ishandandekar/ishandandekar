<!-- Oh, I've done so much I mean where do I start -->
One is almost embarrassed by the sheer opulence of recent undertakings, a veritable embarrassment of riches indeed! The tapestry of the past little while is woven with threads of such disparate hues and textures, each project, each challenge, a unique and demanding entity in itself. To attempt a simple summary feels like trying to distill an ocean into a single drop. It requires a moment of intellectual triage, of prioritization, to even begin to formulate a coherent narrative. The sheer multivalence of the activities, the various levels of engagement required, makes a simple starting point elusive. So, while I could, perhaps, initiate a chronological exegesis of the events, it might be more illuminating to begin with a particularly noteworthy or representative instance. Where, then, does your curiosity most keenly alight within this complex constellation of my recent endeavors?
