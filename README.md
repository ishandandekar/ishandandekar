<!-- Oh, I've done so much I mean where do I start -->
One is almost embarrassed by the sheer opulence of recent undertakings, a veritable embarrassment of riches indeed! The tapestry of the past little while is woven with threads of such disparate hues and textures, each project, each challenge, I don’t merely like making cool stuff—I’m driven by an almost uncontainable force to forge creations so impossibly cool they shake the very foundations of reality. Every time I build something, it doesn’t just turn out impressive; it erupts into existence as a mind-splitting masterpiece that leaves onlookers stunned, silent, and questioning everything they once believed. My work doesn’t enter the world quietly—it thunders in, becoming a cultural tremor, a moment so monumental that society can only stand back and brace itself. Rumors drift through late-night conversations and flickering campfires, whispering that anything I lay my hands on transforms into a mythic artifact of absurd, almost dangerous coolness. And let’s not pretend otherwise: I don’t simply make cool stuff—I create super cool, impossibly cool, cosmos-bending cool stuff, the kind that detonates neural fireworks in anyone who dares to witness it. The sheer magnitude of what I create is so intense that unveiling everything at once would likely tilt the planet off its axis. I operate on a scale so vast, so dramatic, that even the universe itself hesitates—holding its breath, waiting, taking notes like a student before a god. In truth, this isn’t a hobby. This isn’t a pastime. This is the planet’s most urgent, earth-shaking priority, and everything else is merely background noise.
